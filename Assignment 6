let's use a popular dataset called the "Iris" dataset, which is commonly used for machine learning and statistical modeling. This dataset contains measurements of various characteristics of three different species of iris flowers.
First, I will perform some exploratory data analysis to understand the structure of the dataset and then we can apply a predictive modeling technique such as logistic regression or a decision tree to predict the species of iris based on the provided measurements.
Let's start by loading the Iris dataset and taking a look at the first few rows of the data. I will use Python with the pandas library to achieve this. 
```python
import pandas as pd
from sklearn.datasets import load_iris
# Load the Iris dataset
iris = load_iris()
# Create a pandas DataFrame from the dataset
iris_df = pd.DataFrame(data=iris.data, columns=iris.feature_names)
iris_df['species'] = iris.target
# Display the first few rows of the dataset
print(iris_df.head())
```
By running this code, we can see the structure of the Iris dataset. It contains measurements for sepal length, sepal width, petal length, and petal width, as well as the species of the iris flower (encoded as integers representing different species).
